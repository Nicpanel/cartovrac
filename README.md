# CartoVrac of Sweden

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Nicpanel/cartovrac.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Nicpanel/cartovrac)

This project is a fork of the CartoVrac project adapted for Sweden by Zero Waste Uppsala. The map is focused on the Uppsala region but displays all free pacakging shops in Sweden (if they have been registered in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

The initial project is available here: [https://vivreanantes.github.io/cartovrac/](https://vivreanantes.github.io/cartovrac/).
**CartoVrac** is an open-source project that aims to ease people to buy products without packaging and therefore reduce the amount of generated wastes.

The result of this project is visible on [https://map.zerowasteuppsala.org](https://map.zerowasteuppsala.org) 

All the documentation about CartoVrac (how does it work, how to add data and how to re-use the project) is available in the CartoVracr GitHub Pages, here: [https://vivreanantes.github.io/cartovrac/](https://vivreanantes.github.io/cartovrac/)
