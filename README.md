**CartoVrac** is an open-source project that aims to ease people to buy products without packaging and therefore reduce the amount of generated wastes.

This project is focused on the France map but can be used anywhere just changing the coordinates of the bounding box we want to display and fetching right data from Overpass-API.

The result of this project is visible on [https://cartovrac.fr](https://cartovrac.fr) 

All the documentation about CartoVrac (how does it work, how to add data and how to re-use the project) is available in our GitHub Pages, here: [https://vivreanantes.github.io/cartovrac/](https://vivreanantes.github.io/cartovrac/)
