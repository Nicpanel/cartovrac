## How to use CartoVrac for your own country

CartoVrac is an HTML project that presents data extracted from [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org){:target="_blank"} and completed with some specific data stored as JSON files.

We advise you to read first the documentation that explain how the project works: [How does it work](how_does_it_work.md){:target="_blank"}

Here are the steps to follow to build it for your own country:
1. Fork the project on your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork projet on your own computer
3. [Build the projet and configure it](how_to_build_cartovrac.md)
4. [Configure the Circle CI](how_to_build_cartovrac.md#continuous-integration) if you need a continuous integration
5. Adapt the project to your needs
